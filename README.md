My 2nd year project for Internet and Mobile Applications Development module in GMIT.

It is an app for a small courier company or independent couriers. 
It provides some essential functions, such as a form with details to create new delivery orders and a way of keeping track of them,
  a map with the delivery route, an eSignature function and many other useful options.
